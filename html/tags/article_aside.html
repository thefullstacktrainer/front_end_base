            Instant Tournaments
            Instant Tournaments is a feature that helps Facebook users discover and play games with friends and others
            through Feed, building connections with each other through lightweight competition. Instant Tournaments are
            available in both the Instant Games SDK and the Cloud Games SDK.

            Instant Tournaments are a great way to acquire new players, and a good way to keep players engaged during
            the life of the tournament (the default life of a tournament is seven days). Players share a leaderboard to
            their timeline with a prompt for friends to join the challenge. Feed delivery—combined with re-shares by
            players who join—enable tournaments to traverse the friends graph rapidly to help the game acquire more
            players in a short time.

            Why Your Game Should Integrate Tournaments
            Instant Tournaments primarily help with the acquisition of new players. In addition, tournaments improve
            retention while the Tournament is running.

            Because the posts are displayed in the Feed, Instant Tournaments help surface your game to players who have
            never seen it before—especially players who don't usually visit the Facebook Gaming tab. Well-trafficked
            tournaments keep existing players competing for the top spot and bragging rights.
