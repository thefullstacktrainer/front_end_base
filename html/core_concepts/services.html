            <p>Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI, GenAI,[1] or GAI)
                is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, videos, or
                other data using generative models,[2] often in response to prompts.[3][4]
                <br>
            </p>

            <p></p>Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate
            new data that has similar characteristics.[5][6]
            <br>
            Improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large
            language models (LLMs), enabled an AI boom of generative AI systems in the early 2020s.

            <p>
                These include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and LLaMA, text-to-image artificial intelligence
                image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and DALL-E, and text-to-video AI
                generators such as Sora.[7][8][9][10] Companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, and Baidu
                as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative AI models.[3][11][12]
                <br>
                Generative AI has uses across a wide range of industries, including software development,
                healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service,[13] sales and marketing,[14] art, writing,[15]
                fashion,[16] and product design.[17] However, concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of
                generative AI such as cybercrime, the use of fake news or deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people, and
                the mass replacement of human jobs.[18][19]

                Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a type of generative artificial intelligence that has
                information retrieval capabilities. It modifies interactions with a large language model (LLM) so that
                the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this
                information in preference to information drawn from its own vast, static training data. This allows LLMs
                to use domain-specific and/or updated information.[1] Use cases include providing chatbot access to
                internal company data, or giving factual information only from an authoritative source.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
                Process
                The RAG process is made up of four key stages. First, all the data must be prepared and indexed for use
                by the LLM. Thereafter, each query consists of a retrieval, augmentation and a generation phase.[1]
            </p>
            <p>
                Indexing
                The data to be referenced must first be converted into LLM embeddings, numerical representations in the
                form of large vectors. RAG can be used on unstructured (usually text), semi-structured, or structured
                data (for example knowledge graphs).[1] These embeddings are then stored in a vector database to allow
                for document retrieval.

            <p>
                Given a user query, a document retriever is first called to select the most relevant documents which
                will be used to augment the query.[3] This comparison can be done using a variety of methods, which
                depend in part on the type of indexing used.[1]

                What is Conversational AI?
                Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that makes software capable of understanding
                and
                responding to voice-based or text-based human conversations. Traditionally, human chat with software has
                been limited to preprogrammed inputs where users enter or speak predetermined commands. Conversational
                AI
                goes much beyond that. It can recognize all types of speech and text input, mimic human interactions,
                and
                understand and respond to queries in various languages. Organizations use conversational AI for various
                customer support use cases, so the software responds to customer queries in a personalized manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                What are the benefits of conversational AI?
                Conversational AI technology brings several benefits to an organization's customer service teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                Improved customer experience
                Conversational AI chatbots can provide 24/7 support and immediate customer response—a service modern
                customers prefer and expect from all online systems. Instant response increases both customer
                satisfaction
                and the frequency of engagement with the brand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, you can integrate past customer interaction data with conversational AI to create a
                personalized experience for your customers. For instance, it can make recommendations based on past
                customer
                purchases or search inputs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Improved operational efficiency
                You can use conversational AI solutions to streamline your customer service workflows. They can answer
                frequently asked questions or other repetitive input, freeing up your human workforce to focus on more
                complex tasks.

                You can also gain cost benefits at scale. It can be costly to establish around-the-clock customer
                service
                teams in different time zones. It’s much more efficient to use bots to provide continuous support to
                customers around the globe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wider accessibility
                Conversational AI can be used to improve accessibility for customers with disabilities. It can also help
                customers with limited technical knowledge, different language backgrounds, or nontraditional use cases.
                For
                example, conversational AI technologies can lead users through website navigation or application usage.
                They
                can answer queries and help ensure people find what they're looking for without needing advanced
                technical
                knowledge.
